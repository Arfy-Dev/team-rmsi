Breadcrumb -> Home > User > Journal Manager > Static Pages Plugin

The form below shows you all the static pages you have created. 
You can edit or delete the pages using the links on the right-hand side.
Pages can then be accessed at: https://ejournal.uin-suska.ac.id/index.php/RMSI/pages/view/%PATH%, where %PATH% is a value you choose. 
Note: No two pages can have the same path.
